# fastwars-remake
My attempt at an old game that me and my mates knew as fastwars. I am using javascript, namely a javascript library called p5.js https://p5js.org/

Fastwars is a game we used to play in highschool in our IT lessons when we should have been doing work.

Basically circles appear on the screen and grow larger and larger until they 'expolode'. You have to hit them with the mouse before they explode.

One of my very first proper programming attempts. p5.js is brilliant because you get really quick results!

If you clone or download the project you should just be able to run the game from index.html as the p5.js library is added as a CDN.
the sketch.js file is where the main game loop happens and the explosion.js is my explosion class for the circles.

You can do some really cool stuff with p5.js drawing wise so the circles with hopefully eventually morph shapes or change colours depending on size or how close you are to them with the mouse ect.

The code is probably really messy and not optomised at all but I've tripped up in the past with trying to get everything too perfect and just given up. This is a make it work model.

Cheers!
