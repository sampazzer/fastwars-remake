# fastwars-remake
My attempt at an old game that me and my mates knew as fastwars. I am using javascript, namely a javascript library called p5.js https://p5js.org/

Fastwars is a game we used to play in highschool in our IT lessons when we should have been doing work.

Basically circles appear on the screen and grow larger and larger until they 'expolode'. You have to hit them with the mouse before they explode.

One of my very first proper programming attempts. p5.js is brilliant because you get really quick results!
